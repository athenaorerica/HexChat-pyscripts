#HexChat-pyscripts
These are just some miscellaneous scripts for the HexChat IRC client, written in Python.

Most have been tested, but if there's any bugs, make a PR with a fix or open an issue.

(warning: terrible code ahead)

This will never stop being a beta, until everything gets a good score on CC.

Once that happens, I'll mark the scripts as 1.0 release on github.
