#HexChat-pyscripts
These are just some miscellaneous scripts for the HexChat IRC client, written in Python.

Most have been tested, but if there's any bugs, make a PR with a fix or open an issue.

(warning: terrible code ahead)

New releases won't happen until all scripts work and have a good CC score.
